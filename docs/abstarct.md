Abstraction 
This project proposes the development of a Personal Financial Budgeting Management System enhanced with data analytics to improve individual financial decision-making. The system will collect and organize user income, expenses, savings, and bills, then apply descriptive analytics to provide clear financial summaries and visual dashboards. Diagnostic analytics will identify spending patterns and causes of budget overruns, while predictive analytics will forecast future expenses and potential cash shortfalls. Prescriptive analytics will generate personalized recommendations, alerts, and savings strategies based on user behavior. The goal is to transform basic expense tracking into an intelligent, insight-driven budgeting tool that promotes financial discipline, supports goal achievement, and enables proactive financial planning.
