Agenda: Project comprehension and proporsal writing strategy.

The motion first brought under discussion was the comprehension of Tax-o-poly.
- All members shared their understanding of the project idea based on what they read from its documentations and their research.
- A concern was raised on whether an understanding of the board game "monopoly" was necessary for the development of Tax-o-poly. The concern was addressed on a positive note.
- It was said that further research and understanding had to be done on monopoly and taxes in order to fully establish the understand necessary to design Tax-o-poly.
- It was suggested that Tax-o-poly be a Two dimension graphics software application and the members were in favor of the proposed suggestion.

The second motion under discussion was the strategic approach in writing the project proporsal.
- A few suggestions were brought on what approach to write the proporsal and they include:
1. Phase by phase: All the members taking time to construct each section of the project proporsal.
2. Pairing up: The members would split into two groups and each group would work on one section of the proporsal while sharing their ideas for consistency.
3. Split the first four parts of the project proporsal with respect to each member and do the same for the remaining sections 
- It was decided that the members would take the phase-by-phase approach as to ensure that no one is left behind, as well as eliminate ambiguity and further misunderstandings.
- the meeting was dissolved on the note that further background research must be done so that documentation of the project proporsal be in process by Sunday.

Meetings complied and written by Benjamin Chaambwa, group leader.
